# First Machine Learning Project: The Titanic Dataset

<img src="/files/titanic_project/StÃ¶wer_Titanic.jpg" width="500" height="350">

This was my first end-to-end machine learning project on the famous Titanic dataset. It's a classification problem in which we predict which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic. I have implemented several machine learning techniques during this project and gained a respectable position in the leaderboard, within the top 7% of users. 

This notebook also serves as a guide for people new to machine learning! Please do not hesitate to get in contact if you have any questions, or even more so if you spot anything incorrect.

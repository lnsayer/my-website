I graduated from Durham University with a First class degree in physics in 2022. I learnt how to code for my physics projects in which I analysed and visualised data for various experiments. In my master's project I used a bespoke convolutional neural network to predict the transition states of a bacterical ligase. I really enjoyed this project, which combined physics, biology and computer science all in one. I would love to work in this area in the future but am also interested in the applications of machine learning to many problems. 

Currently, I am completing a machine learning and data science course covering shallow and deep learning with classification and regression problems. After learning the basics of Sklearn I undertook a classification challenge with the Titanic dataset, achieving a score within the top 7.3% of submissions (see my work projects). Right now, I am learning more Pytorch and hope to start a bigger project soon. 

In my spare time I love rock climbing and playing touch rugby. At university I captained the university touch rugby team (DUTRC) in my final year. I also volunteer at my local rugby club helping to coach the U15s.

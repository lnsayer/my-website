## Hi there, I'm Louis Sayer 

### I am a physics graduate and aspiring data scientist. I am really interested in how AI can understand and contribute to science, particularly biology.

I graduated from Durham University with an integrated master’s degree in physics. This is when I first gained exposure to machine learning as my master’s project used a deep convolutional neural network to predict and understand protein transition states. I have developed a keen interest in this area ever since!

# Hi there, I'm Louis Sayer 

### I am a physics graduate and aspiring data scientist. I am really interested in how AI can understand and contribute to science, particularly biology.

After taking a gap year I am currently doing my own machine learning projects, which you can check out on my Work Projects and I am a part-time barista. I am looking for work, so get in touch!

When I am not working, I love being in nature and going on adventures. Also, I am learning French, on pourrais parler en Fran√ßais?

Thanks for visiting!
